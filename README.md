## COVID-19 and the Weather, Michele Coscia

We are completing tasks similar to data scientists working for a public health agency, to inform
central governments about possible correlates between COVID-19 and environmental factors facilitating or
hampering its spread. We explore the latest data set of all infections in the year 2020 provided by
the government, and weather data from the IBM Pairs system.

We explore the data from **The Netherlands**.

### The major parts of the project are:
- Exploring and transforming the data, making numerical and visual reports;
- Connecting data tables (weather, infections);
- Investigating possible statistical associations by filtering for a variety of attributes;
- Visualizing the data on a map;
- Involving self-obtained external data sets in the analysis.
